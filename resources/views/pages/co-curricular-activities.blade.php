                    <h2>School Band & Choir</h2>
                    <p>
                        The Band is a contemporary gospel music organization that seeks to provide a blend of
                        contemporary
                        sacred music at school functions and events. It is basically a student-led group that nurtures
                        and
                        harnesses the musical creativity of students. Members learn by peer-teaching and are supervised
                        occasionally by the Music tutor. The Choir is a choral group composed of students who perform at
                        School Church Services, Carols Services and on Speech Days. The Choir also participates in
                        concerts
                        from time to time. It promotes the image of the Schools through its participation on Radio and
                        Television broadcast. It is normally directed by the
                        Music tutor.
                        <br>
                        Membership to the School Band and Choir is open to all students in the Junior and Senior
                        Secondary
                        Schools. These two organizations develop the musical talents of students. This includes
                        cultivating
                        the voice and the playing of musical instruments such as piano/organ, atenteben, guitars, drum,
                        trumpet, saxophone, etc., and the art of choral directing. The Music tutor is the patron of the
                        School Band and Choir. These groups operate only at the Akosombo campus.

                        • bring out and develop the latent talents for acting in students, <br>
                        • give to its members the opportunity to express themselves in public, and thus eliminate stage
                        fright and the fear of speaking in public. <br> <br>
                        The Annual Speech Days of the School can be rightly termed as "the Drama Season". The Drama Club
                        puts up performances during such occasions.
