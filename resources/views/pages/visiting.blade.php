                    <h2>VISITING HOURS</h2>
                    <p>
                        Visiting of students/pupils while school is in session is strictly forbidden. Parents/Guardians
                        and
                        other relations of students, whether Day- students or Boarders, should take serious note of this
                        prohibition. Boarders are not to be visited in the late afternoons and evenings of the school
                        days
                        (i.e. Monday - Friday) either. Visiting days and hours for boarders are the 1st Saturdays of
                        every
                        month, between 2.00p.m. – 5.00p.m. No visitation is permitted on Sundays, therefore
                        Parents/Guardians/relations ought to plan their visits strictly on the appointed days only.
