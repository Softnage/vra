                    <h2>GUIDANCE & COUNSELLING</h2>
                    <p>
                        The Schools offer Guidance and Counselling Services to all pupils/ students. Even though all
                        teachers are involved in such counselling, there are Guidance and Counselling Coordinators who
                        monitor all work done. Academic Guidance and Counselling are offered in: <br> <br>
                        (a) Subject Potentiality: <br>
                        Guidance to students on their individual strengths and weaknesses in the various subjects. <br>
                        <br>
                        (b) Career Guidance: <br>
                        Guidance is oered to students on what jobs or occupations there are, and what subjects and
                        grades
                        are required (at this level) to enable students pursue their various careers in future (i.e.
                        colleges, polytechnics, universities, etc.) <br> <br>
                        (c) Choice of Subjects: <br>

                        Guidance is given to students on their choice of subjects, considering their individual
                        abilities
                        and interest in the various subjects and courses and the careers they wish to pursue. This
                        ensures
                        that students do not choose subjects arbitrarily.
